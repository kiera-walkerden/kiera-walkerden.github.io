         <h2>Professional Profile</h2>
            <p>I am currently studying a Bachelor of Education (Secondary)/Bachelor of Arts (Design Innovation and Technologies) at Australian Catholic University, and I am passionate about inspiring students through engaging, inclusive, and innovative learning experiences. My focus on Design and Technology education stems from a desire to help students think creatively, solve problems, and apply their knowledge in meaningful ways.</p>
            <p>Through my experience as a Teacher’s Aide and Student Support Officer, I have worked closely with students across both primary and secondary levels, including those with diverse learning needs. In these roles, I have developed skills in creating tailored resources, providing individualised instruction, and collaborating effectively with teachers to support student growth. I value building strong relationships with students, staff, and families to create a cohesive and supportive learning environment.</p>
            <p>Beyond the classroom, I am actively involved in my community as a basketball coach, working with children and young people across a wide range of ages and abilities. These experiences have strengthened my leadership, adaptability, and communication skills, and deepened my commitment to helping students achieve their personal best.</p>
            <p>I bring to teaching not only enthusiasm and creativity, but also a reflective approach to continuous professional growth. My goal is to contribute positively to any school community, fostering student achievement and well-being while continuing to grow as an educator.</p>
