                                <h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/banner1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Didn't you just leave school? Why would you want to go back?</b></p>
								<p>My name is Kiera Walkerden, and I am currently studying at university, pursuing a degree in education. I have a strong passion for working with young people and creating inclusive, engaging learning environments that support all students to reach their potential. Through my studies, I've developed an interest in behaviour management, student wellbeing, and designing meaningful, real-world learning experiences.</p>

						<!-- Teaching Philosophy -->
                            <article id="philosophy">
                                <h2 class="major">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/banner2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>What do I believe in the classroom?</b></p>
								<p>I believe that teaching is about more than imparting knowledge. It is about empowering students to become confident, creative, and capable individuals who see themselves as lifelong learners. As a future Design and Technology teacher, I am passionate about equipping students with the skills to innovate, solve problems, and think critically about the world around them.</p>
								<p>My teaching philosophy is grounded in inclusivity, adaptability, and student centred learning. Every student brings unique strengths, experiences, and challenges to the classroom, and it is my responsibility to create a supportive environment where all learners feel valued and capable of success. My experience working as a Teacherâ€™s Aide with students from diverse backgrounds has shown me the importance of tailoring instruction, using ICT and practical strategies to engage learners, and fostering both academic growth and social-emotional development.</p>
								<p>I believe in the power of collaboration, with students, colleagues, and families, to build a learning community that encourages resilience, creativity, and achievement. I strive to be approachable, supportive, and reflective in my practice, modelling lifelong learning for my students. By combining high expectations with empathy and encouragement, I aim to nurture students who are not only prepared for academic success, but also for meaningful participation in their communities.</p>
								<p>Ultimately, my teaching philosophy reflects a commitment to helping students discover their potential, pursue their passions, and grow into innovative thinkers who can thrive in a dynamic and ever-changing world.</p>

						<!-- University Projects -->
                            <article id="projects">
                                <h2 class="major">University Projects</h2>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>What am I up to at uni?</b></p>
								<p>During my time at ACU, I have undertaken many different TAS units, each of these coming with their own assessment tasks and projects.</p>
								<p>This section of my digital portfolio aims to display a few of the projects I have completed, with some information surrounding the assessment task they were made for.</p>
								<br>
								<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Timber - Bluey Stool</b></p>
								<p>This project was completed as part of a Timber assessment task, where I was required to design and construct a low stool for a specific user. I chose my two year old nephew, who loves Bluey, as the intended user. The stool was designed with appropriate dimensions to suit his size and to fit comfortably at his daily table. Additionally, the fabric design was themed to reflect Bluey, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.</p>
								<!-- Insert images -->
								<p>I began by designing the stool and cutting all timber components to size. The pieces were assembled using various joinery techniques, including the domino jointer, to ensure structural stability. I designed the fabric myself, which was printed at the university and then upholstered onto the stool. To refine the finish, I sanded the timber surfaces and applied a protective finish. The seat and backrest were shaped with a vacuum sealing process to create ergonomic curves.</p>
								<!-- Insert CAD image -->
								<br>
								<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Timber - Heirloom Box</b></p>
								<p>This project involved constructing an heirloom box as part of a Timber assessment task, with an emphasis on both joinery precision and decorative design. The box was designed to incorporate keyed mitre joints and a custom decorative veneer lid. I chose blackwood for its durability and aesthetic appeal, and designed a floral pattern for the veneer to enhance the visual impact.</p>
								<!-- Insert images -->
								<p>After selecting and preparing the blackwood, I cut the components using precise measuring and cutting techniques. The decorative floral veneer was cut using a scroll saw and adhered to the lid through a vacuum sealing process to ensure a secure bond. The keyed mitre joints were carefully executed to produce a structurally sound and visually refined box. The finished piece demonstrated both technical skill in joinery and creativity in veneer design.</p>

								<br>
								<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Timber - Laminated Board</b></p>
								<p>This project is a part of my first Timber assessment task in which I had to design and make a Laminated Board. As a part of this task I also needed to develop a maker's mark that would be laser engraved on to my board.</p>
								<!-- Insert images -->
								<p>For this project, I was required to select and cut multiple strips of timber, plane them until their surfaces were flush, arrange them in a cohesive order, and join them together using adhesive. Once the glue had fully dried, I sanded the assembly and applied grapeseed oil as a finish to ensure it was food safe.</p>
								<!-- Insert CAD image -->
								<br>
								<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Metal - Tool Box</b></p>
								<p>This project involved constructing a metal toolbox as part of my recent safety induction for metalwork. The aim was to produce a functional, durable toolbox while developing fundamental skills in measuring, cutting, bending, and assembling sheet metal. The project required careful planning, precision, and adherence to safety protocols throughout the fabrication process.</p>
								<!-- Insert images -->
								<p>To begin, I marked out the required dimensions on the sheet metal and cut the pieces using metal snips. The sheet metal was then bent into the desired shapes using both the Magnabend and a pan brake. To prepare the components for assembly, I used a centre punch to mark the rivet locations and a power drill to create holes. Finally, the pieces were securely fastened together at each end using a riveting gun, resulting in a sturdy and functional toolbox.</p>
								<!-- Insert more images -->
								<br>
								<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Metal - Jewellery Pair</b></p>
								<p>This project required designing and producing a matching jewellery pair consisting of a fidget ring and a necklace, with connected aesthetic elements. The design incorporated a flower motif, with the ring and necklace sharing thematic cohesion. The project aimed to combine functional movement, material contrast, and detailed craftsmanship.</p>
								<!-- Insert images -->
								<p>The ring band was crafted from silver, the flower petals from brass, and the flower center from copper. I cut the components from sheet metal using a jewellery saw and a laser cutter to ensure precise shapes. The petals were joined to the ring band using a rivet made from copper wire, allowing the ring to spin. The metal pieces were shaped with a heat gun and finished by sanding and polishing. For the necklace, I created a copper wire circle, soldered it onto the chain, and attached the second flower component, completing the cohesive set.</p>

								<br>
								<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Textiles - Pyjama Set with Tote Bag</b></p>
								<p>This project involved designing and constructing a coordinated sleepwear and storage bag set, consisting of two garments and a cloth tote bag. The set was intended to be both functional and visually cohesive, featuring an original textile design inspired by daisies. The project required the integration of commercial patterns and fabrics with student-designed printed elements to produce a finished set that reflects both personal creativity and technical skill.</p>
								<!-- Insert images -->
								<p>The elastic-waisted pants were made from poplin with a printed daisy pattern, cut and sewn from a commercial pattern. The T-shirt was a commercially purchased cotton-rich jersey, which I screen-printed with a custom daisy design inspired by my own tattoo. The tote bag was constructed from cotton drill, featuring a yellow body and a pocket made from the same fabric as the pants. I cut and sewed both the pants and bag, while the top required hand preparation for screen printing, followed by precise alignment and printing of my original design.</p>
								<!-- Insert design illustrations image -->
								<br>
								<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>Textiles - Felt Bookmark & Banner</b></p>
								<p>This project required the design and construction of two electronic textile items: a light-up felt bookmark (a hurdle task) and a felt banner with a variable LED light effect. Both items were intended to demonstrate the integration of hand-crafted textile techniques with functional soft-circuit electronics, combining aesthetics, functionality, and technical problem-solving. The overall theme for both items was floral, emphasizing color, texture, and interactive light elements.</p>
								<!-- Insert images -->
								<p>For the light-up bookmark, I constructed a unique piece from commercial wool felt and hand-made felt, embedding a soft circuit with a power source, switch, and LED. The circuit was integrated through hand-stitching and embroidery, using chain stitch and lazy daisy motifs in yellow, orange, and green, with the LED positioned at the center of the flower to illuminate it.</p>
								<p>For the felt banner, I created a multi-layered, hand-stitched piece inspired by a classroom art activity. The design incorporated blended felt to emulate a watercolor effect, with hand-stitched flowers in purple, green, and blue. Three LEDs were embedded in the centers of selected flowers to create a variable light effect and a subtle three-dimensional quality. Both projects required experimentation with design options, careful cutting, hand-stitching, needle-felting, and integration of functional electronic components to achieve the intended visual and interactive outcomes.</p>

                                <h2 class="major">Unit Plans & Resource Samples</h2>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Do you even know how to plan a lesson?</b></p>
								<p>Throughout my degree, I have developed lots of unit plans and lesson resources as well as completed many TAS projects across all specialties.</p>
								<br>
								<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;"><b>Stage 6 Design and Technology</b></p>
								<p>These unit resources were developed for a Stage 6 Design and Technology class in a comprehensive co-educational high school located in the diverse, metropolitan area of Wahroonga in Sydney. The school has a student population of approximately 1000 students, with 21% of students identifying as coming from language backgrounds other than English. The classroom context includes a mixed-ability cohort, including students with Individual Learning Plans (ILPs) and English as an Additional Language or Dialect (EAL/D) support requirements. Diagnostic and formative assessment data indicated a need for targeted support in literacy, critical thinking, and organisation of design ideas.</p>
								<br>
								<p><b>Lesson Topic: Design Industry Professions and Popular Designers</b></p>
								<p>In this task students explore different design professions and how they work together, building understanding of collaboration in the design process and preparing for their case study.</p>
