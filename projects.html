      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>During my time at ACU, I have undertaken many different TAS units, each of these coming with their own assessment tasks and projects.</p>
      <p>This section of my digital portfolio aims to display a few of the projects I have completed, with some information surrounding the assessment task they were made for.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Sample 1 -->
    <section>
      <article>
        <h3>Timber - Bluey Stool</h3>
        <p>This project was made as a part of a Timber assessment task in which I had to design and make a low stool for a user of my choice.</p>
       <figure style="display: flex; gap: 15px; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <img src="images/blueystool.jpeg" alt="Finished Bluey Stool" 
            style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; border-radius: 0 0 0 0;">
        <img src="images/stoolwL.jpeg" alt="Bluey Stool with Nephew" 
            style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; border-radius: 0 0 0 0;">
        </figure>
        <p>I chose to design my stool for my 2 year old nephew who loved Bluey. I designed the fabric to fit the theme, as well as used measurements that would suit his size so that the stool would fit perfectly at the table he eats at each day.</p>

    <!-- Sample 2 -->
    <section>
      <article>
        <h3>Timber - Heirloom Box</h3>
        <p>This project was made as a part of a Timber assessment task in which I had to make an Heirloom Box that used Keyed Mitre Joints, as well as develop the decorative wood veneer design on the lid.</p>
        <figure style="display: flex; gap: 15px; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap;">
        <img src="images/heirloomboxopen.jpeg" alt="Heirloom Box Open"
         style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; border-radius: 0 0 0 0;">
        <img src="images/heirloomboxclosed.jpeg" alt="Heirloom Box Closed"
         style="max-width: 50%; height: 40%; border-radius: 0 0 0 0;">
        </figure>
        <p>I chose to use blackwood for my project after research into different types of wood, and went with a flower design on the veneer lid.</p>

        <h3>Timber - Laminated Board</h3>
        <p>This project is a part of my first Timber assessment task in which I had to design and make a Laminated Board. As a part of this task I also needed to develop a maker's mark that would be laser engraved on to my board.</p>
