            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Throughout my degree, I have developed lots of unit plans and lesson resources as well as completed many TAS projects across all specialities.</p>

            <h2>Design and Technology Unit Resources</h2>

            <article>
            <h3>Stage 6 Design and Technology</h3>
            <p>These unit resources were developed for a Stage 6 Design and Technology class in a comprehensive co-educational high school located in the diverse, metropolitan area of Wahroonga in Sydney. The school has a student population of approximately 1000 students, with 21% of students identifying as coming from language backgrounds other than English. The classroom context includes a mixed-ability cohort, including students with Individual Learning Plans (ILPs) and English as an Additional Language or Dialect (EAL/D) support requirements. Diagnostic and formative assessment data indicated a need for targeted support in literacy, critical thinking, and organisation of design ideas.</p>

            <h3>Lesson Topic: Design industry professions and popular designers</h3>
            <p>In this task students explore different design professions and how they work together, building understanding of collaboration in the design process and preparing for their case study.</p>

        <!-- Sample 2: Factors affecting design -->
            <h3>Lesson Topic: Factors affecting design / design detective</h3>
            <p>In this task students will learn about factors that influence design by defining each factor with an example. They will then choose a product, identify which factors shaped its design, and use AI to check and extend their understanding.</p>
