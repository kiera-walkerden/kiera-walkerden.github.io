            <h2>What do I believe in the classroom?</h2>
                <p>I believe that teaching is about more than imparting knowledge. It is about empowering students to become confident, creative, and capable individuals who see themselves as lifelong learners. As a future Design and Technology teacher, I am passionate about equipping students with the skills to innovate, solve problems, and think critically about the world around them.</p>
                <p>My teaching philosophy is grounded in inclusivity, adaptability, and student centred learning. Every student brings unique strengths, experiences, and challenges to the classroom, and it is my responsibility to create a supportive environment where all learners feel valued and capable of success. My experience working as a Teacher’s Aide with students from diverse backgrounds has shown me the importance of tailoring instruction, using ICT and practical strategies to engage learners, and fostering both academic growth and social-emotional development.</p>
                <p>I believe in the power of collaboration, with students, colleagues, and families, to build a learning community that encourages resilience, creativity, and achievement. I strive to be approachable, supportive, and reflective in my practice, modelling lifelong learning for my students. By combining high expectations with empathy and encouragement, I aim to nurture students who are not only prepared for academic success, but also for meaningful participation in their communities.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, my teaching philosophy reflects a commitment to helping students discover their potential, pursue their passions, and grow into innovative thinkers who can thrive in a dynamic and ever-changing world.</p>
